                Artisacs, founded by Ruhaan Malhotra, champions sustainability
                through innovative design, transforming waste materials into
                artful, eco-friendly tote bags. Committed to Dubai's no-plastic
                initiative, Artisacs offers an impactful alternative that
                marries environmental consciousness with style, making
                sustainability accessible and practical.

                Each tote bag features Ruhaan's original pop art-inspired
                designs, combining bold visuals with a message of environmental
                responsibility. Beyond providing a sustainable alternative,
                Artisacs is a social enterpriseâ€”proceeds from each bag are
                directed to the Udyam Trust NGO in New Delhi, where Ruhaan
                personally spends his summers. There, he teaches underprivileged
                children pop art and self-expression, using art as a tool for
                empowerment and education. Through Artisacs, Ruhaan not only
                contributes to reducing plastic waste but also creates
                meaningful opportunities for youth in need, making a positive
                impact on both community and planet.
